# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Alan Gonzalez

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
At the beginning of the SITE Program Pre-work, I, unfortunately, was not familiar with any of the programming languages presented in the challenge. Since I have only completed CS1, the course had only shown us Java, so Java was the only programming language I knew about. However, during the process of following the tutorial given by codepath, I have been introduced to 3 new programming languages which I rapidly understood as the tutorial went on. The major problem I faced was the randomized creation of an array that would represent the pattern given to the user at the time of playing the light and sound memory game. Unfortunately, this was an optional challenge, therefore the tutorial did not contain much information about it, but a hint or clue, which allowed me to investigate further the functions necessary to address the problem. However, during the process of exploration, my mind led me to investigate the problem itself and find the solution, which may be considered plagiarism. Fortunately, even though I took a piece of code from someone else, I fully understood the intention of the code by reading the parameters and logically reasoning the purpose of each function used, giving me more experience and allowing me to implement it on my own in the future.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
When it comes to web development, personally, there are many questions that come to mind as I am particularly interested in such activity. As this is my first time developing HTML,CSS, and Javascript, and found the syntax simple, I can finally begin to wonder what other problems I may be able to tackle in the future with the newly acquired knowledge and how much more I could learn. I would like to know how a website hosts the product, how a website can handle multiple users at the same time, how can user data be stored for future use, and where could I learn more.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
As I have heard in the past, "best is never permanent". Meaning there will always be a better way to do something. In my case, I would use the additional time to improve the user experience. Specifically, the design, as currently, is a basic HTML page that resembles a PowerPoint document with a background color. Details such as text font, sound effects, button styles, maybe background music, and animations would allow for an enjoyable user experience. Unfortunately, I just began to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript, therefore developing such functions and features may take a long time for me to investigate, learn, and implement.
